# Javascript-GNN

Welcome to the **Javascript-GNN** repository! This project is an interactive, browser-based Graph Neural Network (GNN) demo implemented in JavaScript and HTML. The goal of this repository is to provide an accessible and fully-editable playground for building, training, and understanding simple GNN models—right in your browser, with no dependencies.

## About the Project

This repository lets you experiment with the core ideas of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which operate directly on graph-structured data, going beyond grids and vectors to handle social, chemical, network, or any data where nodes and edges matter. The implementation here mirrors the clarity and transparency of the [Javascript-MLP](https://github.com/matthewJamesAbbott/Javascript-MLP) and [Javascript-CNN](https://github.com/matthewJamesAbbott/Javascript-CNN) tools.

You can configure your network, build graphs with node features and edge lists, set custom targets, and watch training and inference—all in one HTML file.

### Built With
- **HTML**: For the full-featured interactive UI  
- **JavaScript**: For GNN logic, training, and visualization

## Features

- Interactive UI for configuring number of nodes, node feature dimension, hidden layer size, output size, and message passing layers
- Hands-on node feature editing—update per-node attributes directly from the browser
- Flexible edge definition (as CSV or manual entry)
- Customizable output vector/target for supervised experiments
- Control training iterations with instant feedback
- Lightweight, pure browser implementation (no dependencies, instant load)
- Readable, fully-commented JavaScript for educational clarity

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/matthewJamesAbbott/Javascript-GNN.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

_No build scripts or server processes required._
